# Feature Implementation: Forecast Toggle Reset on Favorite Location Click

## Overview

Implemented a feature that automatically resets the 5-day forecast toggle button back to "View Forecast" when clicking on any favorite location on the Home page.

## Problem Addressed

Previously, when users:

1. Clicked "View Forecast" to show the 5-day forecast (button changed to "Hide Forecast")
2. Then clicked on a favorite location
3. The forecast button would still show "Hide Forecast" even though the forecast was hidden

This created a confusing user experience where the button state didn't match the actual forecast visibility.

## Solution Implemented

### Files Modified

1. **`/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx`** - Updated favorite location click handlers

### Changes Made

#### 1. onClick Handler

Added `setShowHomeForecast(false)` to reset the forecast toggle state when clicking a favorite location:

```javascript
onClick={() => {
  // Reset forecast toggle when selecting a new location
  setShowHomeForecast(false);
  selectLocation({
    type: "city",
    city: favorite.city || favorite.name,
    name: resolvedName,
    country: favorite.country,
    state: favorite.state,
    countryCode: favorite.countryCode,
    coordinates: favorite.coordinates,
  });
  scrollToWeatherSection();
}}
```

#### 2. onKeyDown Handler

Added the same reset logic for keyboard accessibility:

```javascript
onKeyDown={(e) => {
  if (e.key === "Enter" || e.key === " ") {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Reset forecast toggle when selecting a new location
    setShowHomeForecast(false);
    selectLocation({
      type: "city",
      city: favorite.city || favorite.name,
      name: resolvedName,
      country: favorite.country,
      state: favorite.state,
      countryCode: favorite.countryCode,
      coordinates: favorite.coordinates,
    });
    scrollToWeatherSection();
  }
}}
```

## How It Works

### State Management

- The `showHomeForecast` state controls both the forecast section visibility and the button text
- `setShowHomeForecast(false)` ensures:
  - The 5-day forecast section is hidden
  - The button text returns to "View Forecast"
  - Users can click the button again to view the new location's forecast

### Button Text Logic

The WeatherCard component determines button text based on `isForecastVisible` prop:

```javascript
{
  isForecastVisible ? "Hide Forecast" : "View Forecast";
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix

1. User shows forecast → Button: "Hide Forecast"
2. User clicks favorite → Weather changes, forecast hidden, but Button still: "Hide Forecast" ❌
3. User confused about button state

### After Fix

1. User shows forecast → Button: "Hide Forecast"
2. User clicks favorite → Weather changes, forecast hidden, Button: "View Forecast" ✅
3. Clear and consistent button state

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Created comprehensive test guide: `/docs/TEST_FORECAST_TOGGLE_RESET.md`

### Automated Testing

Created test script: `/tests/frontend/test-favorite-forecast-toggle-reset.js`

### Test Cases

1. ✅ Button resets to "View Forecast" when clicking favorite locations
2. ✅ Forecast section becomes hidden when switching locations
3. ✅ Works with both mouse clicks and keyboard navigation
4. ✅ Consistent behavior across multiple favorite locations
5. ✅ User can show forecast again for the new location

## Accessibility

- Maintains keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space keys)
- Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA states
- Focus management preserved during location switching

## Performance Impact

- Minimal impact: Only adds a single state setter call
- No additional API calls or DOM operations
- Leverages existing state management patterns

## Documentation Updates

- Added feature to `FEATURES_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- Created detailed testing guide
- Provided automated test script for future regression testing

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - Feature fully implemented and tested
