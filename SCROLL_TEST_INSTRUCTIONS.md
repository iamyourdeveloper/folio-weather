# üîç Testing Scroll-to-Forecast Functionality

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status
The scroll-to-forecast functionality has been **successfully implemented and enhanced** on both HomePage and SearchPage.

## üß™ How to Test

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app should be running at: http://localhost:3007 (or the port shown in your terminal)

### 2. Test on HomePage
1. **Navigate to HomePage** (http://localhost:3007)
2. **Wait for weather data to load** for your current location or a default city
3. **Click the "View Forecast" button** in the weather card
4. **Observe**: The page should automatically scroll down to reveal the 5-day forecast section
5. **Check browser console** for success message: "‚úÖ Scrolled to forecast section on HomePage"

### 3. Test on SearchPage
1. **Navigate to SearchPage** (http://localhost:3007/search)
2. **Search for any city** (e.g., "New York", "London", "Tokyo")
3. **Wait for weather data to load**
4. **Click the "View Forecast" button** in the weather card
5. **Observe**: The page should automatically scroll down to reveal the 5-day forecast section
6. **Check browser console** for success message: "‚úÖ Scrolled to forecast section on SearchPage"

## üîß What Was Enhanced

### Before:
- Basic scroll implementation with simple timeout
- No retry mechanism if element wasn't ready
- Fixed 200ms delay

### After:
- **Robust retry mechanism**: Attempts scroll up to 5 times if element isn't ready
- **Better timing**: Initial 200ms delay + 100ms retry intervals
- **Centered scrolling**: Forecast section scrolls to center of viewport
- **Debug logging**: Clear console messages for troubleshooting
- **Error handling**: Logs if scroll fails after all attempts

## üéØ Expected Behavior

When you click "View Forecast":
1. **Forecast section appears** with 5-day weather data
2. **Page automatically scrolls** smoothly to center the forecast section in view
3. **Console shows success message** confirming the scroll worked
4. **Button text changes** from "View Forecast" to "Hide Forecast"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If scroll doesn't work:
1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Verify forecast data loads** (you should see the 5-day forecast cards)
3. **Try different cities** on SearchPage
4. **Check network requests** in DevTools to ensure API calls succeed

## üßπ Cleanup
After testing, the debug console logs can be removed by running the cleanup script (will be created after testing confirms functionality).
