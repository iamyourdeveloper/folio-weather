# Chat History - FolioWeather Development

This folder contains all the conversations and development sessions that led to the creation of the FolioWeather application. These chat logs serve as a comprehensive record of the development process, decisions made, and features implemented.

## Purpose

- **Knowledge Retention**: Preserve all technical discussions and implementation details
- **Development History**: Track the evolution of features and architecture decisions  
- **Learning Resource**: Reference material for understanding the codebase and development approach
- **Debugging Aid**: Historical context for troubleshooting and future enhancements

## Chat Session Organization

Each chat session is documented with:
- **Date and Duration**: When the session occurred and how long it lasted
- **Objectives**: What was planned to be accomplished
- **Key Accomplishments**: What was actually implemented
- **Technical Decisions**: Important architectural or implementation choices made
- **Challenges Faced**: Problems encountered and how they were resolved
- **Next Steps**: What was planned for future sessions

## File Naming Convention

Chat files are named using the format:
`YYYY-MM-DD_SessionN_[Brief-Description].md`

Example: `2024-12-19_Session1_Initial-Project-Setup.md`

## How to Use This Documentation

1. **For New Developers**: Start with Session 1 to understand the project genesis
2. **For Feature Understanding**: Look for sessions that implemented specific features
3. **For Troubleshooting**: Search for similar issues in previous sessions
4. **For Architecture Decisions**: Review early sessions for foundational choices

## Contributing to Chat History

When adding new chat sessions:
1. Use the established naming convention
2. Include all required sections (objectives, accomplishments, etc.)
3. Be detailed about technical decisions and reasoning
4. Include code snippets or references where relevant
5. Update this README with new sessions
