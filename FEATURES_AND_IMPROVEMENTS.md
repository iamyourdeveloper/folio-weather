## 🗑️ Code Cleanup & Optimization Completed

### Cache Clearing & Performance Optimization

1. **Cache Files Removed**: Cleared all development logs, build artifacts, and temporary files
2. **Build Optimization**: Generated optimized production build with code splitting and compression
3. **Bundle Analysis**: Achieved optimized bundle sizes with vendor chunking and lazy loading
4. **Dependencies Optimized**: Moved unused dependencies (mongoose, bcryptjs) to optionalDependencies

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Organized Test Files**: Moved all test files to `/tests/` directory with proper categorization
2. **Backend Models**: Identified unused MongoDB models (User, FavoriteLocation, WeatherAlert) - these are ready for future implementation but not currently active
3. **Debug Code**: Preserved necessary console.log statements for development while removing outdated debug code
4. **Unused Imports**: Cleaned up redundant imports and dependencies
5. **Linting**: Addressed code quality issues and standardized formatting

### Files Organized

- **API Tests**: `tests/api/` - Connection and API integration tests
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/` - Header search and location tests
- **Development Tests**: `tests/development/` - Formatting, pagination, and search tests
- **Performance Tests**: `tests/performance/` - Reserved for future performance testing

### Build Optimization Results

- **Frontend Bundle**: Optimized to ~609KB total (137KB gzipped)
- **Code Splitting**: Vendor, router, and utils chunks for better caching
- **Source Maps**: Generated for production debugging
- **Asset Optimization**: Compressed CSS and JavaScript files
