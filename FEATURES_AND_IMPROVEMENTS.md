## 🗑️ Code Cleanup Completed

### Removed Unnecessary Code
1. **Organized Test Files**: Moved all test files to `/tests/` directory with proper categorization
2. **Backend Models**: Identified unused MongoDB models (User, FavoriteLocation, WeatherAlert) - these are ready for future implementation but not currently active
3. **Debug Code**: Preserved necessary console.log statements for development while removing outdated debug code
4. **Unused Imports**: Cleaned up redundant imports and dependencies

### Files Organized
- **API Tests**: `tests/api/` - Connection and API integration tests
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/integration/` - Header search and location tests
- **Development Tests**: `tests/development/` - Formatting, pagination, and search tests
- **Performance Tests**: `tests/performance/` - Reserved for future performance testing
